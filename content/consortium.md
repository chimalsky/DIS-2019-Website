title: "Doctoral Consortium"
---

The DIS 2019 Doctoral Consortium provides current doctoral candidates unique opportunities to present their projects to receive feedback from, and engage in exchanges with researchers and peers in design-related fields from around the world, in a stimulating, open, and safe environment.</br>

You must be enrolled in a design-related discipline as a doctoral candidate at the time of submitting your application and at the time of the conference. You will get most value from attending if you are already in possession of a clear direction for your thesis but have not yet finished your research. However, people at other stages may be considered. We are expecting to take up to 10 people.</br>

As part of submissions to the Doctoral Consortium, we invite you to consider the conference theme, “Contesting Borders and Intersections.” With this theme, we encourage submissions that critique, resist, and/or reimagine taken-for-granted boundaries in interactive design research and practices, as well as those that present innovative thinking, and creative or provocative interaction design. </br>
