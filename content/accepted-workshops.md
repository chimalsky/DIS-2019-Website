__W4: [Towards a Research Agenda for Gameful Creativity](https://gamefulcreativity18.wordpress.com/)__ [Open Registration]  </br> 
*Sarah-Kristin Thiel, Christian Remy, Licinio Roque, Rita Orji, Peter Dalsgaard, Celine Latulipe, Sayan Sarcar* </br> 
Abstract: We propose a one-day workshop that focuses on the intersection of gamefulness and creativity. The objective of this workshop is to bring together both researchers and practitioners interested in this field to discuss a research agenda that will explore the relationship between game-related aspects (e.g. game play, game genres) and creative thinking.
Embracing the interdisciplinarity of creativity, we invite researchers from a variety of fields including but not limited to games, gamification, playfulness and creativity research. In a highly interactive format, we aim to consolidate previous work, identify relevant areas for future research, and discuss methods to assess the effectiveness of gamefulness on individuals’ creative potential. As outcomes of the workshop we hope to set a research agenda and establish a vibrant community around the domain of gamefulness and creativity. </br>

__W5: [Crafting and Tasting Issues in Everyday Human-Food Interactions](https://humanfoodinteraction.wordpress.com/)__ [Open Registration] </br> 
   *Markéta Dolejšová, Ferran Altarriba Bertran, Danielle Wilde, Dr. Hilary Davis* </br> 
   Abstract: From cooking and growing to shopping and dining, digital technology has become a frequent companion in our everyday food practices. Smart food technologies such as online diet personalization services and AI-based kitchenware offer promises of better data-driven food futures. Yet, human-food automation presents certain risks, both to end consumers and food cultures at large. This one-day workshop aims to question emerging food-tech trends and explore issues through creative food-tech crafting and performative dining activities. We will craft, taste, and debate edible prototypes reflecting on diverse socio-political issues in contemporary food-tech innovation. We posit everyday human-food practices as a relatable context to discuss broader societal issues underlying the growing role of technology and data in commonplace human activities. The workshop aims to gather an interdisciplinary group of researchers and practitioners keen on exploring the diverse roles and potential futures of technology design in everyday life.

__W6: [Exploring, Defining, & Advancing Community-Driven Design for Social Impact](https://designlab.ucsd.edu/events/community-driven-design-workshop-dis-2019/)__ [Open Registration]</br> 
*Eric Hekler, Jennifer Taylor, Steven Dow, m.c. schraefel, Sayali Phatak, Don Norman, Faren Grant, Dana Lewis* </br> 
Abstract: As the DIS community increasingly seeks to address social impact issues, it becomes important to examine the assumptions behind our methods to increase the likelihood of positive effects and reduce negative unintended consequences. The purpose of this workshop is to engage the design community in exploring, defining, and, if deemed valuable, advancing community-driven design. We invite DIS members to submit 1-page responses to this concept of community-driven design. Our hope is that a research agenda can emerge from this workshop for the DIS community.

__W7: [CoDesigning AI Futures: Integrating AI Ethics, Social Computing, and Design](https://codesigningaifutures.wordpress.com)__ [Open Registration] </br> 
*Daria Loi, Christine T. Wolf, Raphael Arar, Jeanette Blomberg, Margot Brereton* </br> 
Abstract: As recent scholars have noted, there is little discourse amongst the HCI, interaction design, and UX communities on topics of AI and their relationship to design practice, a gap this workshop aims to address. Bringing together practitioners and researchers from a variety of backgrounds, this workshop sets out three goals: (1) identify case studies and projects at the intersection of HCI and AI, highlighting their ethical dimensions; (2) identify the chief challenges to HCI and AI collaborations and strategies to address them; and (3) foster a community for continued discourse and development on the intersections between AI Ethics, social computing, and design.

__W8: [Academic Accomplices: Practical Strategies for Research Justice](http://accomplices.lmc.gatech.edu/)__ [Invitation Only] </br> 
*Mariam Asad, Lynn Dombrowski, Sasha Costanza-Chock, Sheena Erete, Christina Harrington* </br> 
Abstract: This workshop brings together folks currently or interested in becoming academic accomplices, or scholars committed to leveraging resources and power to support the justice work of their community collaborators. Academic accomplices are necessary for research justice—research that materially challenges inequity—and owe it to community partners to challenge underlying oppressive structure and practices as perpetuated through academic research. The goal of this workshop is to discuss concrete strategies for challenging oppression through research methodologies, physical or institutional resources, and/or pedagogy. This workshop will generate practical strategies for research justice for DIS and HCI scholars.

__W9: [At the Intersection of Culture & Method: Designing Feminist Action](https://cultureandmethoddis2019.wordpress.com/)__ [Invitation Only] </br> 
*Melanie Feinberg, Sarah Fox, Jean Hardy, Stephanie Steinhardt, Palashi Vaghela* </br> 
Abstract: Boundaries and borders continue to draw political attention and create conflict on a global scale. They interrupt or facilitate people and money, and influence how designers and politicians alike work in opposition to oppression. This one-day workshop will explore the use of design research and computing practice in resisting and reifying inequalities. Recognizing that technology production is only a partial response to caring for ourselves and our environment, participants of this workshop will consider the design commitments, pedagogies, and labor that produce new strategies for more equitable futures. We will collectively ask and grapple with the following questions: 1) what are the current concerns and pressures of our community in producing feminist means and ends, 2) how do we work as academics, activists, allies and advocates through our design activities; and 3) whose opportunities, hopes, fears, innovations, and futures are we building? </br> 
 
__W10: [Exploring Noticing as Method in Design Research](https://artsofnoticing.com)__ [Invitation Only] </br> 
*Szu-Yu (Cyn) Liu, Jen Liu, Kristin Dew, Patrycja Zdziarska, Maya Livio, Shaowen Bardzell* </br> 
Abstract: The aim of this one-day workshop is to explore, practice, and develop methodological approaches for HCI researchers and practitioners to “notice differently” and envision more ethical and responsible ways of engaging in technological interventions. In this workshop, we will focus on what anthropologist Anna Tsing calls the “arts of noticing”, methods of looking beyond progress narratives, cultivating awareness of diverse actors, and engaging in alternative ways of knowing (e.g. embodied knowledge and activist commitments) in design research and practice. The workshop will include discussion, a walkshop, and hands-on group exercises that develop “arts of noticing” appropriate to the DIS community.

__W11: [Intersection in HCI, Design and Dementia](https://design-intersections.wineme.wiwi.uni-siegen.de)__ [Open Registration]</br> 
*Rens Brankaert, Gail Kenning, Daniel Welsh, James Hodge, Sarah Foley, David Unbehaun* </br> 
Abstract: Participatory approaches are used to design interactive systems, services and products to improve their impact and usability. However, these approaches are not always suitable for people with cognitive limitations such as dementia. This workshop will focus on participatory approaches for working with people living with dementia, challenge assumptions and provide concrete examples to inform design and technology development. Participants will review current design and technology offerings and work towards the development of a shared research agenda for future work. The workshop will explore how to negotiate the need for inclusion, personalisation, and scalability to accommodate the growing needs in dementia. It will focus on setting an inclusive agenda for developments in Design and HCI in the ‘here and now’ to build sustainable approaches for the future.

__W12: [A sample of One: First-person Research Methods in HCI](https://1stpersonresearch.wordpress.com)__ [Open Registration]</br> 
*Andrés Lucero, Audrey Desjardins, Carman Neustaedter, Kristina Höök, Marc Hassenzahl, Marta Cecchinato* </br> 
Abstract: First-person research (i.e., research that involves data collection and experiences from the researcher themselves) continues to become a viable addition and, possibly even, alternative to more traditional HCI methods. While we have seen the benefits of using methods such as autoethnography, autobiographical design, and autoethnographical research through design, we also see the need to further explore, define, and investigate the practices, techniques, tactics, and implications of first-person research in HCI. To address this, this one-day workshop aims to bring together a community of researchers, designers, and practitioners who are interested in exploring and reimagining research in HCI and interaction design, with an emphasis on first-person methods.

__W13: [Designing at the End of the World](https://endoftheworld2019.wordpress.com)__ [Open Registration]</br> 
*Jonas Fritsch, Ann Light, Daria Loi* </br> 
Abstract: We are living in a time of ecological and humanitarian crisis that requires imminent action from the joint fields of HCI and interaction design. In a very palpable way, we seem to be moving towards the “end of the world” (certainly, as we have known it). This workshop addresses three concrete end-of-world challenges – the end of nature, end of culture and end of the human – to contribute to a much-needed design research agenda and to build community in the process. The workshop will explore how the design of technology can support a fairer and more secure set of futures by considering these three end-states and what we, as participants (both contributing to futures and living with the outcomes), can offer to improve the options. Contributions to theory and practice will be welcome.

__W14: [Larping (Live Action Role Playing) as an Embodied Design Research Method](https://interaction.mere.st/)__ [Invitation Only] </br> 
*Elena Márquez Segura, Katta Spiel, Karin Johansson, Jon Back, Zach O. Toups, Jessica Hammer, Annika Waern, Josh Tanenbaum, Katherine Isbister* </br> 
Abstract: Embodied design methods are gaining popularity among design researchers. They leverage the physical and situated experience of designers to access and better understand present and future situations, humans, and design opportunities. Here, we propose a workshop to learn about, engage with, and discuss larping (live action role playing) as an embodied design research method, in particular as: i) a sensitizing activity prior to design; and ii) a test-bed to investigate and further iterate design concepts and prototypes. The workshop is organized by design research experts in embodied design methods and larps, and it is aimed at those interested in embodied design methods, with or without experience with larps. Insights from the workshop will be captured in a joint article extending current embodied design methods.
