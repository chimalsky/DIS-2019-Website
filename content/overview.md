__Keynote: Screen Smashing: Iconoclasty in an Age of Illusionary Intelligence__</br>
_Tiffany Shlain & Ken Goldberg_</br>

Abstract: “Late twentieth-century machines have made thoroughly ambiguous the difference between natural and artificial, mind and body, self-developing and externally designed, and many other distinctions that used to apply to organisms and machines. Our machines are disturbingly lively, and we ourselves are frighteningly inert.” - Donna Haraway. Simians, Cyborgs, and Women: The Reinvention of Nature.

The boundaries that Haraway lamented in 1990 were further eroded by the World Wide Web, wireless networks, smartphones, and today by social media, fake news, claims about Artificial Intelligence and an impending “Singularity”. Are all boundaries truly illusionary? Or can we question illusions of illusion by actively asserting boundaries between ourselves and our machines? Artistic collaborators Shlain and Goldberg will describe how their art projects and experiences with technology are leading them to rediscover old barricades.</br>

__Keynote: Virtual Reality and the Feeling of Virtue: Women of Color Narrators, Enforced Hospitality, and the Leveraging of Empathy__</br>
_Lisa Nakamura_</br>

Abstract: Many researchers and evangelists argue that V.R. is fundamentally more “moving” than other media because of users’ visual immersion in navigable worlds and their empathic identification with another visual perspective. (see Rubin, Bailenson). This essay will analyze women of color’s labor as virtual reality’s documentary subjects whose digital presence and hospitality within war-torn, emiserated, and inhospitable scenes such as a Lebanese refugee camp, a favela, and a cucumber farm enables a fantasy of virtuous empathy on the part of the viewer.

Virtual reality’s painstakingly created virtuous identity as the “empathy machine” satisfies desires for prosocial feelings of compassion, empathy, and identification that replace encounters with politics, unwelcome bodies, and protest. Global South women of color, non-white refugee women, and trans women are all virtual objects of identification in virtual reality and video games, platforms that are inextricably connected yet carry very different moral and ethical connotations.</br>

# Panel: Theory and Its Obligations
## Thursday, June 27, 4:00 PM – 5:30 PM
## Room: Bayview 1
### Organizers: Jeffrey Bardzell and Paul Dourish
### Panelists: Margot Brereton, Lilly Irani, and Vera Khovanskaya
Abstract: The DIS community has a long tradition of using the works of philosophers and critical theorists in research, including such thinkers as Heidegger, Foucault, Butler, Shusterman, Verbeek, and Tsing. When we think about theory in design, a number of questions arise. First, is theory only ever imported, or can we think about DIS research as a site at which theory is produced? Second, what are our obligations to get theory right in its own terms while also making it accessible and useful to the DIS community? Third, what are our responsibilities for contributing back to the theoretical traditions from which we are drawing? This panel will explore the range of obligations and responsibilities that characterize the DIS community’s engagement with theory.</br>

# Panel: Designing Change and Changing Design </br> 
## Friday, June 28, 11:00 AM – 12:30 PM </br> 
## Room: Mission 2/ 3</br> 
### Organizer: Josh Tanenbaum</br> 
### Panelists: Jon Back, Stacy Branham, Sarah Fox, Cindy Lin, and Norman Su</br> 
Abstract: Herbert Simon defined design as “courses of action aimed at changing existing situations into preferred ones.” We ask: “better for whom?” Design implicitly privileges certain points-of-view, bodies, and communities. The Change through Design paper subcommittee invited the DIS community to consider design’s potential to enact positive change, and tackle complex societal, environmental, and political challenges. We asked what are the ethical and moral dimensions of design? Who is allowed to participate in design? Our community has long discussed questions of ethical design. Currently, stakes for design are especially high as we reckon with the detrimental impact of technology on interpersonal relationships, governance, and environmental health. In this panel we reflect upon how we can balance the tension between our stated values, and the pathologies of capitalism.</br>

__Keynote: The Role of Space Technology to Support Sustainable Development__</br>
_Danielle Wood_</br>

Abstract: MProfessor Danielle Wood leads the new Space Enabled Research Group at the MIT Media Lab. The Space Enabled Research Group advances justice in Earth’s complex systems using designs enabled by space. Space Enabled sees opportunities to advance justice by increasing access to space technology to development leaders around the world and by applying space technology in support of the Sustainable Development Goals, as curated by the United Nations. There are six space technologies that have been contributing to the Sustainable Development Goals for decades, but barriers remain that limit their impact. These technologies include satellite earth observation, satellite communication, satellite positioning, microgravity research, technology transfer and increasing research infrastructure. The Space Enabled Research Group implements projects with development leaders at the multi-lateral, national and local scale to apply space technology in support of their initiatives. During these projects, Space Enabled implements an integrated design process that includes techniques from engineering design, art, social science, complex systems modeling, satellite engineering and data science. During this talk, Prof Wood will discuss the role of space to spur innovation and development and give examples of projects pursued by the Space Enabled Research Group. </br>
