## T-Shirt Design Contest
This year we call on students to design a cool t-shirt for both DIS and C&C SVs to wear while on duty. If your design is selected by the organizing committee, you get a free SV spot for DIS 2019! As a winner, you can either take or give it to a friend (as long as they are eligible to work as an SV; see eligibility and responsibilities on DIS 2019 website). 

If you are interested in participating in the t-shirt design competition, please submit your design, including both the front and back of the shirt, as an image or PDF using the following link by April 26th, 2019:

### Details and Suggestions:
 
This year DIS is co-located with Creativity and Cognition (http://cc.acm.org/2019/). Your design needs to have logos of both the conferences. You may want to connect your design with the theme of either or both the conferences (Contesting Borders and Intersections / Transformational Creativity), or the location of the conference (San Diego, California). It doesn't matter as long as it's fun, interesting, and can stand out a bit in the crowd.
 
Please send us front and back designs of the t-shirt. Please note that we cannot print on the sleeves or the extreme edges of the t-shirt.
 
The imprint size is roughly 11” wide and 13” high front or back.
 
DIS and C&C logos are available at https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/13RgjkvPdJw8ztsx06mVEpZAYCPz94eL3?usp=sharing
 
The designs can be submitted as a PDF, JPG, or PNG format. If your design is selected as a winning design, we will require the final version to be either in .eps or .ai format.
 
You can submit several designs or variations.
 
The deadline for submission is April 26, 2019. We will select a winner in the week following the contest submission deadline.
 
You are welcome to use online design tools, such as CustomInk (www.customink.com/lab) or SpreadShirt (http://www.spreadshirt.com/design-your-own-t-shirt-C59) in creating your design.

## Call for student volunteers:
Student volunteers (SVs) are essential to the success of the DIS2019 conference. Being an SV provides a unique opportunity to contribute to organizing a conference as well to interact closely with DIS contributors, attendees, and your peers. As student volunteer, you will also receive a fabulous free t-shirt and get a full conference pass providing you access to all the paper sessions, workshops, demos, and social events. However, workshop registration fees, meals, and hotel expenses are not part of the SV benefits. As an SV, you are expected to work around 15-20 hours during the conference. 

DIS SVs will be chosen through a random lottery system at [chisv.org](http://chisv.org/DIS2019/). In addition, we encourage you to consider participating in the t-shirt design competition. The selected design’s creator will be offered an SV spot during DIS. More info about the T-shirt design competition will be announced later. In total, we expect to accept 30 SVs for DIS2019.

Please note that DIS2019 will be co-located with C&C2019. While you might have the opportunity to attend both conferences or work in joint activities (e.g., joint keynote), you can serve as an SV at only one of the conferences. This application process only applies to DIS2019. If you wish to SV for C&C2019, please apply separately. The SV chairs for both conferences will coordinate to ensure that there are no duplicate applications.

## Eligibility and responsibilities:
To register, you must be enrolled as an undergraduate, masters, or doctoral student between January to May in 2019 (e.g., Spring 2019). Students who are graduating at the time of the conference are also eligible to apply. DIS2019 will take place in San Diego, please note that it is your responsibility to obtain necessary travel visas if required. To apply, no previous experiences are required, but we are looking for people who are friendly, enthusiastic, and reliable.

As an SV, you are expected to:
-	Work around 15-20 hours during the five days of the conference 
-	Show up on time to assigned tasks 
-	Attend an orientation session (June 22) before the conference
-	Wear the SV t-shirt when you are in duty, so people can easily spot you

## Tentative schedule for DIS2019:
- Sun and Mon, June 23-24: DIS workshops
- Tue, June 25: DIS Doctoral Consortium 
- Wed, June 26: First day of DIS (technical program + DIS banquet) + joint events with C&C (in the form of joint keynotes)
- Thursday, June 27: 2nd day of DIS: opening keynote of DIS, technical program, DIS reception (snacks/drinks with demo programs) 
- Friday, June 28: 3rd day/final day of DIS: closing keynote + technical program
