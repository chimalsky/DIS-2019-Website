ACM DIS2019 Student Volunteers

## Important dates:

- April 1st, 2019: Applicants will be informed of their acceptance or waitlist status

## Call for student volunteers:
Student volunteers (SVs) are essential to the success of the DIS2019 conference. Being an SV provides a unique opportunity to contribute to organizing a conference as well to interact closely with DIS contributors, attendees, and your peers. As student volunteer, you will also receive a fabulous free t-shirt and get a full conference pass providing you access to all the paper sessions, workshops, demos, and social events. However, workshop registration fees, meals, and hotel expenses are not part of the SV benefits. As an SV, you are expected to work around 15-20 hours during the conference. 

DIS SVs will be chosen through a random lottery system at [chisv.org](http://chisv.org/DIS2019/). In addition, we encourage you to consider participating in the t-shirt design competition. The selected designâ€™s creator will be offered an SV spot during DIS. More info about the T-shirt design competition will be announced later. In total, we expect to accept 30 SVs for DIS2019.

Please note that DIS2019 will be co-located with C&C2019. While you might have the opportunity to attend both conferences or work in joint activities (e.g., joint keynote), you can serve as an SV at only one of the conferences. This application process only applies to DIS2019. If you wish to SV for C&C2019, please apply separately. The SV chairs for both conferences will coordinate to ensure that there are no duplicate applications.

## Eligibility and responsibilities:
To register, you must be enrolled as an undergraduate, masters, or doctoral student between January to May in 2019 (e.g., Spring 2019). Students who are graduating at the time of the conference are also eligible to apply. DIS2019 will take place in San Diego, please note that it is your responsibility to obtain necessary travel visas if required. To apply, no previous experiences are required, but we are looking for people who are friendly, enthusiastic, and reliable.

As an SV, you are expected to:
o	Work around 15-20 hours during the five days of the conference 
o	Show up on time to assigned tasks 
o	Attend an orientation session (June 22) before the conference
o	Wear the SV t-shirt when you are in duty, so people can easily spot you
