The art exhibition will present artworks that manifest the conferences’ joint themes of Contesting Borders and Intersections and Transformational Creativity. </br> 

## ‘ECOLOGIES OF TRANSFORMATION’
The "interface" is dead. It depended upon distinctions between elements that needed some intermediation. This was always an illusion, but it served some purpose for a time in simplifying design tasks while more substantial system ecologies developed. But we were never separate from systems that needed an interface, and now, the idea that the interface mediates interactions between us and computational systems misses almost the entire mark as human interactions, computational devices and the world become ever more entangled into social, economic, political, and environmental relations. A better concept might be the interlace. We are inherently intertwined with myriad systems with myriad agencies. And most of these systems are not primarily about us, we just live there. Some of these conditions are better engaged with enhanced visibility and cogence, and for others, it makes no difference.

We seek activities in art, design and other, unnamable phenomena that give us some indication of what this might look/feel/smell/taste/sound like (or exist on some other carrier wave). We are looking for pointers (art, performance, sound) towards our condition that arises from the many interactions in- and foldings across, complex systems that transcend scales of time, space, materiality, cognition and logics. Maybe interfaces haven’t died, they’ve just fractally multiplied and become pervasive at all levels, becoming the fabric of our material/computational/biotic phenomena. Help us come to grip. Submit your work that indicates, clarifies and problematizes this condition.

## Opportunities and infrastructures:
Works can be in a variety of forms such as interactive installations, virtual and/or augmented realities, experimental cinematic shorts, performances and/or works that are suited to special technological platforms that will be part of the exhibition venue. You should indicate in your application the environmental needs of your work, i.e. needs to be in the dark/light, listens to sound/makes sound, can be outdoors, has a time duration, it runs once, it loops, etc.

The exhibition will take place in Atkinson Hall home of the Qualcomm Institute, the UC San Diego home of the California Institute of Telecommunications and Information Technologies (CalIT2). We will look for work that can take advantage of the multiple spaces in this venue which include:

- a white walled gallery </br>
- an atrium </br>
- an outdoor patio </br>
- a black box with a 78 gigapixel, 40 foot long x 10 foot tall, tiled display wall </br>
- an auditorium with 8K projection, 32 channels of surround sound and a stage for performances </br>
- a virtual reality room, the Sun-CAVE, made from 32 4K stereo video panels. </br>

For these specialized technologies, we will have additional interaction with selected artists for a period of time before the conference. </br>

## To submit: </br>
We are accepting two forms of submissions; 1) submissions of existing works and 2) proposals for doing work with the specialized infrastructure available at the venue (the Sun-CAVE, black box display wall, 8K projection).

Send links to a visual portfolio of the artwork, including images and video for time based work. Submit a one page narrative description of the piece, including both its conceptual goals and its functional operations. On another page, provide all of its technical and logistical requirements, including equipment needed, whether you are providing that equipment, space requirements, including any special auditory, lighting or other physical need, time needed for set-up, and whether the piece needs to be staffed during the exhibition.
Proposition for existing infrastructure should include the proposed description of current state of the project (max 2 pages), any existing documentation of the work in other forms, and a proposed development path.
All selected artists will get a free day of registration for both conferences. We can also provide limited funding for travel and practical expenses related to the exhibition pieces. More details soon.
