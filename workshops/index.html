<p>We welcome proposals for hosting a workshop at DIS 2019 that align with the conference theme. Workshops offer unique opportunities for diverse groups of scholars, practitioners, and researchers to spend focused time on generative topics. A workshop format is ideal for working together on open, unresolved or controversial issues and developing a diverse range of outputs. Well designed and facilitated workshops attract broad interdisciplinary interest, inspire interaction between participants and foster community-building. We encourage proposals to host a workshop that encourage participants to engage in alternatives to established approaches in design and computing; this can include but is not limited to artistic and humanistic approaches, craft, tinkering, hacking, feminist, postcolonial, and longer-term approaches to design, reflective engagements with politics and cultures of design.</p>

<h1 id="workshop-planning">Workshop Planning</h1>

<p>DIS 2019 workshops will be held on the first two days of the conference (23-24 June, 2019); workshops may be for half-day, whole day, or two days. Plan for 6 working hours per day, with morning, afternoon and lunch breaks. Reserving unhurried time for socializing is critical. Workshops should aim to attract between 10-25 participants.</p>

<p>We encourage provocative, interdisciplinary, boundary crossing and experimental proposals that relate to the topics of DIS:</p>

<ul>
<li>Design Methods and Processes: Methods, tools, and techniques for engaging people; researching, designing, and co-designing interactive systems; participatory design, design artefacts, research through design; the use of critical theory, feminist methods, counter-factual histories and cultural analysis to understand, critique and reflect on design products and contexts as well as design practices.</li>
<li>Experience: Places, temporality, people, communities, events, phenomena, aesthetics, user experience, usability, engagement, empowerment, disruption, wellbeing, designing things that matter, diversity, participation, materiality, making, etc.</li>
<li>Themes: Sustainability, Health, resilience, longer-term approaches, children-computer interaction, games and play, digital arts, making, craft, digital labor, etc.</li>
<li>Technological Innovation (systems, tools, and/or artifact designs): Sensors and actuators, mobile devices, multi touch and touchless interaction, social media, personal, community, public displays, smart objects and/or intelligent systems, open source hardware, IoT, artificial intelligence, etc.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="the-conference-context">The Conference Context</h1>

<p>There are some unusual elements to consider when proposing a workshop for DIS 2019:</p>

<ul>
<li>Joint with Creativity and Cognition 2019: DIS and C&amp;C will share the conference venue. If you believe that your topic would be of particular interest to attendees of C&amp;C as well as DIS, please note it. The Workshop Chairs of C&amp;C and DIS will share proposals to create an overall program of workshops that not only serve the particular needs and interest of their own communities but will look for opportunities to increase the dialogue between them, as well as try to minimize duplication.</li>
<li>Taking advantage of location and theme: Workshops that involve local engagement around the DIS 2019 theme of contesting borders and intersections are encouraged. While the conference does have on-site space, innovative workshops that are place-specific in the San Diego area are invited; such proposals need to explain access plans.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="important-dates">Important Dates</h1>

<ul>
<li><strong>Proposals to host a workshop due:</strong> 18 January 2019 (The submission system closes at 23:59 PST)</li>
<li><strong>Notifications to authors on whether their proposed workshop was accepted:</strong> 8 March 2018</li>
<li><strong>All camera ready papers due:</strong> 22  March 2018</li>
<li><strong>Workshops and Doctoral Consortium:</strong> 23-24 June 2018</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="submission-details">Submission Details</h1>

<p>Proposals to host a workshop have two separate components submitted as separate files: 1) a 4 page abstract, and 2) a detailed workshop description:</p>

<h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>

<p>An abstract describing your proposed workshop should be up to 4 pages in length including references in the <a href="https://sigchi.org/templates/" target="_blank">SIGCHI Extended Abstracts Format</a>, submitted via Precision Conference System. This will serve as the longer-term record of accepted workshop proposals. The submission should contain:</p>

<ul>
<li>Title and proposed duration</li>
<li>Organizersâ€™ names and institutional addresses (proposals are not anonymized for review)</li>
<li>Workshop theme and goals, background and motivation</li>
</ul>

<p>Detailed Workshop Description: A workshop description should also be submitted (as a separate file), containing details of your proposed workshop to help the workshop chairs understand the specifics. Please include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Intended audience and recruitment strategy</li>
<li>Schedule and description of activities planned</li>
<li>Intended outcomes of the workshop, their benefits and significance</li>
<li>Required facilities</li>
<li>Specifications of your work, including size, weight, light and sound emission</li>
<li>A plan for how the results of the workshop will be disseminated beyond DIS 2019</li>
<li>Short biographies of the organizers (including photos)</li>
<li>A draft 250-word call for participation for your workshop which will be posted on the DIS 2019 conference website. This should contain information on how and what potential participants should submit to you.</li>
</ul>

<p>All submissions will be reviewed by the workshop chairs. Successful proposals to host a workshop should describe how the workshop format will be leveraged to generate clear outcomes and to make constructive and valuable use of the participantsâ€™ collective expertise. Social, active and engaging workshop concepts with clear collaborative outcomes will be preferred, as will workshops that have strong potential to generate cross-disciplinary interest.</p>

<p>For first time workshop organizers, successful submissions from previous DIS conferences are a helpful indication of appropriate content and style:</p>
